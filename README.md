# Sentimental-Analysis-along-with-Target-Improvement
The project analyzes the sentiment of restaurant reviews using machine learning techniques to extract important characteristics like ambiance, service, and meal quality, as well as to identify areas for improvement and consumer satisfaction.

# What is Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a technique that uses natural language processing to determine whether text expresses positive, negative, or neutral emotions or opinions.

# Key Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies reviews as positive, negative, or neutral
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifies key aspects of restaurant experience (food, service, ambiance, price)
-**Improvement Targeting**: Prioritizes areas for business improvement based on customer feedback
- **Customer Satisfaction Metrics**: Tracks satisfaction trends over time
- **Performance Optimization**: Utilizes cross-validation and Q-learning techniques

# Core Technologies

- Python for data processing and model implementation
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text analysis
- Machine Learning models for sentiment classification

# Key Techniques

- **Cross-Validation**: Ensures model robustness and prevents overfitting
- **Q-Learning**: Reinforcement learning approach that optimizes decision-making based on customer feedback patterns
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
- **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF, word embeddings, aspect-based feature extraction
- **Model Evaluation**: Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics

# Steps Involved

**Library Integration**: Import and configure all necessary programming libraries to support the project's functionalities.

**Sentiment Categorization by Ratings**: Classify sentiments based on existing rating data to establish initial sentiment categories.

**Text Pre-processing:** Implement robust text pre-processing techniques, including lemmatization and stemming, to standardize and prepare textual data for analysis.

**Sentiment Score Generation (VADER)**: Utilize the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) tool to generate sentiment scores for the processed text.

**Sentiment Categorization by Score**: Categorize sentiments more granularly based on the generated sentiment scores.

**Sentiment Score Visualization**: Develop visual representations to effectively illustrate and interpret the distribution and trends of the sentiment scores.

**Model Evaluation (Cross-Validation)**: Evaluate the performance and robustness of the developed model using cross-validation techniques to ensure reliable results.

**Learning Curve Analysis**: Plot the learning curve to assess the model's performance as a function of training data size, identifying potential overfitting or underfitting issues.

**Targeted Improvement (Q-Learning)**: Implement Q-learning algorithms to drive targeted improvements and optimize decision-making processes.

**Insight Visualization from Q-Tables**: Visualize the key insights derived from the Q-tables to demonstrate learned policies and optimal strategies.
