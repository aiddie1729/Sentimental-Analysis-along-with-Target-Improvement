# Sentimental-Analysis-along-with-Target-Improvement
The project analyzes the sentiment of restaurant reviews using machine learning techniques to extract important characteristics like ambiance, service, and meal quality, as well as to identify areas for improvement and consumer satisfaction.

**Key Features**

**Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies reviews as positive, negative, or neutral
**Feature Extraction**: Identifies key aspects of restaurant experience (food, service, ambiance, price)
**Improvement Targeting**: Prioritizes areas for business improvement based on customer feedback
**Customer Satisfaction Metrics**: Tracks satisfaction trends over time
**Performance Optimization**: Utilizes cross-validation and Q-learning techniques

**Core Technologies**

Python for data processing and model implementation
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text analysis
Machine Learning models for sentiment classification

**Key Techniques**

**Cross-Validation**: Ensures model robustness and prevents overfitting
**Q-Learning**: Reinforcement learning approach that optimizes decision-making based on customer feedback patterns
**Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
**Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF, word embeddings, aspect-based feature extraction
**Model Evaluation**: Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics

**Essential Libraries**


python 3.8+
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
nltk
tensorflow/pytorch
